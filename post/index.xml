      <description>This year I entered my first BSidesLondon challenge. Each year BSidesLondon post challenges in order to win a ticket to the event. The first challenge was to analyze an executable and shutdown the botnet - and in doing so, get the girl and save the world! (OK I made that last bit up, but it&amp;rsquo;s nice to have a story around it)
This post was originally my submission but I didn&amp;rsquo;t win&amp;hellip;probably because there are far better people than me submitting reports and in a small way it probably didn&amp;rsquo;t help that I was lazy and didn&amp;rsquo;t bother to decode the password function and just took the password off the stack and shut the botnet down.</description>

      <description>Last month the Coursera course &amp;lsquo;Malicious Software and its Underground Economy: Two Sides to Every Story&amp;rsquo; finished.
The course was run over 6 weeks and included a bunch of video lectures each week followed by additional reading and a quiz. You can find an overview of the course here. It looks like this was the second time the course has been run - which is probably about right, I&amp;rsquo;m normally late to the party.</description>
