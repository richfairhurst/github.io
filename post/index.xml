      <title>BSides London 2014: Challenge 1</title>

      <description>This year I entered my first BSidesLondon challenge. Each year BSidesLondon post challenges in order to win a ticket to the event. The first challenge was to analyze an executable and shutdown the botnet - and in doing so, get the girl and save the world! (OK I made that last bit up, but it&amp;rsquo;s nice to have a story around it)
This post was originally my submission but I didn&amp;rsquo;t win&amp;hellip;probably because there are far better people than me submitting reports and in a small way it probably didn&amp;rsquo;t help that I was lazy and didn&amp;rsquo;t bother to decode the password function and just took the password off the stack and shut the botnet down.</description>

      <description>Last month the Coursera course &amp;lsquo;Malicious Software and its Underground Economy: Two Sides to Every Story&amp;rsquo; finished.
The course was run over 6 weeks and included a bunch of video lectures each week followed by additional reading and a quiz. You can find an overview of the course here. It looks like this was the second time the course has been run - which is probably about right, I&amp;rsquo;m normally late to the party.</description>

      <description>Lanyon is an unassuming Jekyll theme that places content first by tucking away navigation in a hidden drawer. It&amp;rsquo;s based on Poole, the Jekyll butler.
Built on Poole Poole is the Jekyll Butler, serving as an upstanding and effective foundation for Jekyll themes by @mdo. Poole, and every theme built on it (like Lanyon here) includes the following:
 Complete Jekyll setup included (layouts, config, 404, RSS feed, posts, and example page) Mobile friendly design and development Easily scalable text and component sizing with rem units in the CSS Support for a wide gamut of HTML elements Related posts (time-based, because Jekyll) below each post Syntax highlighting, courtesy Pygments (the Python-based code snippet highlighter)  Lanyon features In addition to the features of Poole, Lanyon adds the following:</description>

      <description>Jekyll is a static site generator, an open-source tool for creating simple yet powerful websites of all shapes and sizes. From the project&amp;rsquo;s readme:
 Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory [&amp;hellip;] and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server. This is also the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host your projectâ€™s page or blog right here from GitHub.</description>
